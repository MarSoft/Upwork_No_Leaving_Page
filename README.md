# Upwork No-Leaving-Page
This userscript can be installed in Greasemonkey (and probably Chrome or other browsers).
It will "bypass" Upwork's "you are leaving Upwork" page.
Actually it will just immediately redirect you whenever that page is shown, but not overwrite outer links.
I think this approach is faster, and it was easier to implement.
